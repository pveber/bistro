  (synopsis "A library to build and run distributed scientific workflows")
  (description "
bistro is an OCaml library to build and run computations represented
by a collection of interdependent scripts or OCaml functions, as is
often found in data analysis.

Features:
- build complex and composable workflows declaratively
- simple and lightweight wrapping of new components
- resume-on-failure: if something fails, fix it and the workflow will
  restart from where it stopped
- parallel workflow execution
- development-friendly: when a script is modified, bistro
  automatically finds out what needs to be recomputed
- automatic naming of generated files
- static typing: detect file format errors at compile time
