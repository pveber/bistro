v0.2.0 2017-04-21 Lyon
----------------------

Major rewrite:
- new execution engine
  + generic notion of task graph (DAG)
  + compilation of workflow representation to a task DAG
  + logging facilities
  + transparent execution of commands through docker container
  + removal of intermediate targets during execution
  + notion of precious workflow (that should be kept no matter what)
- call of regular ocaml function as new type of workflow
- applicative term to express an action that should be performed after a
  set of workflows has been successfully executed
- text logging
- logging as HTML report
- added a collection of Dockerfile scripts

and (too) many bug fixes.


v0.1.0 2016-05-19 Lyon
----------------------

Many minor changes in API.

Installation scripts for tools are no longer considered part of
analysis workflow. Installing programs should be dealt with outside
bistro.

Features:
- heredoc for shell EDSL
- new np and mem tokens for scripts, as a way to use only the
  resources that were allocated to a run

Bug fixes:
- bistro execution hangs on utop (f4f932f)
- don't save workflow in database statistics, just its id (issue #4)


v0.0.0 2016-01-21 Lyon
